<h1>My recruitment profile</h1>
<h2> About me</h2>
<p>I've always felt a deep happiness in helping others. When I do something kind and see a smile appear on someone's face, it gives me a sense of peace and purpose. Along with that, I have a strong passion for photography, especially capturing moments that tell a story through nature, animals, and real emotions. For me, every picture holds a message, and every act of kindness creates a memory. Helping people and freezing beautiful moments through my lens are two things that truly make me feel alive and connected to the world.</p>
<h2>Skills and Experience</h2>
<p>I have hands-on experience helping my community during the COVID-19 pandemic, where I supported people daily and distributed immunity boosters. My efforts motivated many in my region, and I received a certificate in recognition of this work. Alongside that, I've built experience in photography, especially storytelling through nature and animal shots. Both serving others and capturing meaningful moments reflect my passion and dedication.</p>
